## Releasing latest version

- Use [release.yml](https://github.com/flexera/actions-aws-autoscaler/actions/workflows/release.yml) to create a new release from GitHub UI.
- Test the release manually on an internal workflow. (because this is a public repo it is not possible to test a runner with this)
- Use [update-v1.yml](https://github.com/flexera/actions-aws-autoscaler/actions/workflows/update-v1.yml) to update `v1` to the new release created in the previous step to automatically update other workflows.
- `v1` release should be used in other pipelines to receive latest updates.
